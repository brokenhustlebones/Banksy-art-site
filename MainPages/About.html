    <div class="panel panel_left">
        <p>Banksy's name and identity remain unconfirmed and the subject of speculation.
            In a 2003 interview with Simon Hattenstone of The Guardian, Banksy is described as "white, 28,
            scruffy casual—jeans, T-shirt, a silver tooth, silver chain and silver earring. He looks like
            a cross between Jimmy Nail and Mike Skinner of The Streets." Banksy began as an artist at the
            age of 14, was expelled from school, and served time in prison for petty crime. According to
            Hattenstone, "anonymity is vital to him because graffiti is illegal". Banksy reportedly
            lived in Easton, Bristol during the late 1990s, before moving to London around 2000.

            Banksy is commonly believed to be Robin Gunningham, as first identified by The Mail on
            Sunday in 2008, born on 28 July 1973 in Yate, 12 miles (19 km) from Bristol.
            Several of Gunningham's associates and former schoolmates at Bristol
            Cathedral School have corroborated this, and in 2016, a study by researchers at the
            Queen Mary University of London using geographic profiling found that the incidence of
            Banksy's works correlated with the known movements of Gunningham. According
            to The Sunday Times, Gunningham began employing the name Robin Banks, which eventually became
            Banksy. Two cassette sleeves featuring his art work from 1993, for the Bristol band Mother
            Samosa, exist with his signature. In June 2017, DJ Goldie referred to Banksy as "Rob".

    <button class="accordion ">Early career (1990–2001)</button>
    <div class="panel panel_right">
        <p>Banksy started as a freehand graffiti artist in 1990–1994 as one of Bristol's
            DryBreadZ Crew (DBZ), with two other artists known as Kato and Tes.
            He was inspired by local artists and his work was part of the larger Bristol
            underground scene with Nick Walker, Inkie and 3D. During this time he met
            Bristol photographer Steve Lazarides, who began selling Banksy's work, later becoming his
            agent.</p>
        <p>By 2000 he had turned to the art of stencilling after realising how much less time
            it took to complete a work. He claims he changed to stencilling while hiding from the police
            under a rubbish lorry, when he noticed the stencilled serial number and by employing this
            technique, he soon became more widely noticed for his art around Bristol and London. </p>
            <p>He was
            the goalkeeper for the Easton Cowboys and Cowgirls football team in the 1990s, and toured with
            the club to Mexico in 2001. Banksy's first known large wall mural was The Mild Mild West
            painted in 1997 to cover advertising of a former solicitors' office on Stokes Croft in Bristol.
            It depicts a teddy bear lobbing a Molotov cocktail at three riot police.</p>

        <button class="accordion">Exhibitions (2002–2003)</button>
    <div class="panel panel_left">
        <p>On 19 July 2002, Banksy's first Los Angeles exhibition debuted at (33 and 1/3) Gallery,
            a tiny Silver Lake venue owned by Frank Sosa and was on view until 18 August.
            The exhibition, entitled Existencilism, "an Exhibition of Art, Lies and Deviousness"
            was curated by (33 and 1⁄3) Gallery, Malathion LA's Chris Vargas, Funk Lazy Promotions' Grace Jehan,
            and B+. The flyer of the exhibition indicates an opening reception was followed by a
            performance by Money Mark with DJ's Jun, AL Jackson, Rhettmatic, J.Rocc, Coleman. Some of
            the paintings exhibited included Smiley Copper H (2002),
            Leopard and Barcode (2002), Bomb Hugger (2002), and Love is in the Air (2002).</p>
        <p>In 2003, at an exhibition called Turf War, held in a London warehouse, Banksy painted on animals.
            At the time he gave one of his very few interviews, to the BBC's Nigel Wrench. Although the
            RSPCA declared the conditions suitable, an animal rights activist chained herself to the railings
            in protest. An example of his subverted paintings is Monet's Water Lily Pond, adapted to include
            urban detritus such as litter and a shopping trolley floating in its reflective waters; another is
            Edward Hopper's Nighthawks, redrawn to show that the characters are looking at a British football
            hooligan, dressed only in his Union Flag underpants, who has just thrown an object through the glass
            window of the café. These oil paintings were shown at a twelve-day exhibition in Westbourne Grove,
            London in 2005.

    <button class="accordion">Barely Legal (2004–2006)</button>
    <div class="panel panel_right">
        <p>In August 2004, Banksy produced a quantity of spoof British £10 notes
            replacing the picture of the Queen's head with Diana, Princess of Wales's
            head and changing the text "Bank of England" to "Banksy of England". Someone threw a
            large wad of these into a crowd at Notting Hill Carnival that year, which some recipients
            then tried to spend in local shops. These notes were also given with invitations to a Santa's
            Ghetto exhibition by Pictures on Walls. The individual notes have since been selling on eBay.
            A wad of the notes was also thrown over a fence and into the crowd near the NME signing tent at
            the Reading Festival. A limited run of 50 signed posters containing ten uncut notes was also
            produced and sold by Pictures on Walls for £100 each to commemorate the death of Princess Diana.
            One of these sold in October 2007 at Bonhams auction house in London for £24,000.</p>
        <p>The reproduction of images of the banknotes classifies as a criminal offence
            (s.18 Forgery and Counterfeiting Act 1981). In 2016, the American Numismatic Society received an
            email from a Reproductions Officer at the Bank of England, which brought attention to the illegality
            of publishing photos of the banknotes on their website without prior permission. The Bank of England
            holds the copyright over all its banknotes.

               <button class="accordion">Banksy effect (2006–2007)</button>
               <div class="panel panel_left">
                   <p>After Christina Aguilera bought an original of Queen Victoria as a lesbian and two prints for
                       £25,000, on 19 October 2006, a set of Kate Moss paintings sold in Sotheby's London for
                       £50,400, setting an auction record for Banksy's work. The six silk-screen prints, featuring
                       the model painted in the style of Andy Warhol's Marilyn Monroe pictures, sold for five times
                       their estimated price. Their stencil of a green Mona Lisa with real paint dripping from her
                       eyes sold for £57,600 at the same auction. In December, journalist Max Foster coined the
                       phrase, "the Banksy effect", to illustrate how interest in other street artists was growing
                       on the back of Banksy's success.</p>
                   <p>On 21 February 2007, Sotheby's auction house in London auctioned three works, reaching the highest
                       ever price for a Banksy work at auction: over £102,000 for Bombing Middle England. Two of his
                       other graffiti works, Girl with Balloon and Bomb Hugger, sold for £37,200 and £31,200
                       respectively, which were well above their estimated prices. The following day's auction
                       saw a further three Banksy works reach soaring prices: Ballerina with Action Man Parts reached
                       £96,000; Glory sold for £72,000; Untitled (2004) sold for £33,600; all significantly above price
                       estimates. To coincide with the second day of auctions, Banksy updated his website with a
                       new image of an auction house scene showing people bidding on a picture that said, "I Can't
                       Believe You Morons Actually Buy This Shit."</p>
                   <p>In February 2007, the owners of a house with a Banksy mural on the side in Bristol decided to
                   sell the house through Red Propeller art gallery after offers fell through because the prospective
                   buyers wanted to remove the mural. It is listed as a mural that comes with a house attached.

               <div class="panel panel_right">
                   <p>In March, Nathan Wellard and Maev Neal, a couple from Norfolk, UK, made headlines in Britain when
                       they decided to sell their mobile home that contains a 30-foot mural, entitled Fragile Silence,
                       done by Banksy a decade prior to his rise to fame. According to Nathan Wellard, Banksy had
                       asked the couple if he could use the side of their home as a "large canvas", to which they
                       agreed. In return for the "canvas", the Bristol stencil artist gave them two free tickets to
                       the Glastonbury Festival. The mobile home purchased by the couple 11 years earlier for £1,000,
                       was priced at £500,000.</p>

                   <p>Also in March 2008, a stencilled graffiti work appeared on Thames Water tower in the middle of
                       the Holland Park roundabout, and it was widely attributed to Banksy. It was of a child painting
                       the tag "Take this—Society!" in bright orange. London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham
                       spokesman, Councillor Greg Smith branded the art as vandalism, and ordered its immediate
                       removal, which was carried out by H&F council workmen within three days.</p>

                   </p>The Westminster City Council stated in October 2008 that the work One Nation Under CCTV,
                   painted in April 2008 would be painted over as it was graffiti. The council said it would
                   remove any graffiti, regardless of the reputation of its creator, and specifically stated that
                   Banksy "has no more right to paint graffiti than a child". Robert Davis, the chairman of the council
                   planning committee told The Times newspaper: "If we condone this then we might as well say that any
                   kid with a spray can is producing art." The work was painted over in April 2009. In December
                   2008, The Little Diver, a Banksy image of a diver in a duffle coat in Melbourne, Australia, was
                   destroyed. The image had been protected by a sheet of clear perspex; however, silver paint was
                   poured behind the protective sheet and later tagged with the words "Banksy woz ere". The image
                   was almost completely obliterated.<p/>
